Health has always been a crucial part of human society. Humans throughout history have invested a lot of resources and time in improving health and healthcare. Although in ancient times only elites had access to premiere medicine and treatment with passage of time healthcare became affordable and available to large section of general population. But the Coronavirus pandemic have given some serious challenges to both technological and medical advancements. Although medicine and healthcare had made some serious strides for longevity of human life it had hard time fighting the COVID-19 virus. Many lost their loved ones during this pandemic, although we cannot go back in time to save them, what we can do is built on our shortcoming. 

One of the major deficiencies of our healthcare management system that we recognized during this time of pandemic is the ease of access. As there was an exponential spread of the virus the governments ordered for nationwide lockdown and many people, we forced to isolate themselves in unfamiliar places also access to good healthcare consultation was drastically reduced and fake news only added to the panic and chaos. 

But as the old saying goes “Necessity is the mother of invention”, so was the case with us our project, it was need of the hour. A healthcare management system which works efficiently even in this time of crisis. A virtual platform to access consultation from healthcare professionals. Our project not only facilitates access to healthcare, but it implicitly aids in curbing false information about medicines and other health related issues during pandemic crisis like COVID.  

Apart from insulating our healthcare services from crisis situations we also aim at revamping the current structure of the Healthcare industry. We aim to make consultation fast, accessible and easy, no waiting in long queues for taking an appointment. Our vision includes to not only extend provide services for the Allopathic diagnosis and medical treatment but also for Ayurvedic and Homeopathic and other traditional treatment methodologies.

Frontend: We choose the HTML, CSS and React combination to develop the frontend.  

(a.) Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser, it defines the whole skeletal structure of the web page. 

(b.) Cascading Style Sheets CSS assists HTML technology to increase its visual appeal. 

(c.) React Js is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components and its used along with HTML and CSS. 

 

Backend: The backend of our web application is purely developed on Node Js. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.  

 

Hosting & Miscellaneous services: For hosting and other miscellaneous services we used AWS. Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
